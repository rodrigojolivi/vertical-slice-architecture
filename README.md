Project Description
.NET 8 Project with Vertical Slice Architecture
This project is a demonstration of a modern application built using .NET 8 and the Vertical Slice Architecture. The Vertical Slice Architecture approach allows for organizing the codebase by features rather than technical concerns, promoting better separation of concerns and improving maintainability and scalability.

Key Features:
Vertical Slice Architecture: Each feature is self-contained, encapsulating its own data, logic, and presentation, resulting in clear boundaries and easier to manage code.
.NET 8: Leverages the latest features and improvements of .NET 8, ensuring high performance and modern development practices.
Fake Repository: Incorporates a fake repository for data storage, allowing for easy testing and prototyping without the need for a real database. This helps in focusing on business logic and behavior-driven development.

Components:
Features: Organized into vertical slices where each slice contains everything related to a specific feature, including handlers and data access.
Controllers: Minimal and only responsible for handling HTTP requests and delegating work to the appropriate vertical slice.
Fake Repository: Implements an in-memory data store to mock database interactions, facilitating development and testing.

Benefits:
Improved Maintainability: By organizing the project by features, it becomes easier to locate and manage related code.
Enhanced Testability: With the use of a fake repository, unit tests can be written without the overhead of setting up a real database.
Scalability: The architecture supports the easy addition of new features without affecting existing ones, making the project scalable and adaptable to future requirements.

This project serves as a robust template for building feature-oriented applications in .NET 8, showcasing the effectiveness of the Vertical Slice Architecture and the convenience of using a fake repository for development and testing purposes.
